# HicadCommunity
HiCAD community library

Note: some project references are linked to `lib/*.dll` these files can be version dependent. You can find the DLL's where HiCAD is installed
* HiCAD\exe
* HiCAD\exe\API

This library currently developed on HiCAD 2020 (2501.2), You can use the library for a older/newer version since the API of HiCAD almost always remains it's method and function. When upgrading HiCAD it's possible other result(s) will be returned due to the Core of HiCAD, or the behaviour of functions are changed.
