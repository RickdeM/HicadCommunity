# HiCAD Community API Toolbox

Due to all the ongoing changes in the market, companies must be able to act quickly on its processes. Automation is becoming increasingly important to develop and build products faster. This includes error reduction, repetitive actions and the processing of digital data.

Because there is little knowledge in the field of the HiCAD API, I started this Community toolbox. The goal is to share knowledge, creating a versatile toolbox.

# Cloning the project

Some project references are linked to `lib/*.dll` these files can be version dependent. You can find the DLL's where HiCAD is installed
* HiCAD\exe
* HiCAD\exe\API

This library currently developed on HiCAD 2020 (2501.2), You can use the library for a older/newer version since the API of HiCAD almost always remains it's method and function. When upgrading HiCAD it's possible other result(s) will be returned due to the Core of HiCAD, or the behaviour of functions are changed.
